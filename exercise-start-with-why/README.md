  The WHY is the purpose, cause or belief that drives us all. This exercise
  enables students to understand how different organisations have different
  drivers, and then to apply that to themselves.

# 3 Start with why



#### INTRO TO START WITH WHY

Simon Sinek's _Start With Why_ shows that the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world all think, act, and communicate the same way -- and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.

#### WORKSHOP PART ONE

The first part of this workshop asks students to take an example company (in the example below we have used Kniterate), look at their online presence and analyse what their Why, How and What might be.

#### WORKSHOP PART TWO

The second part of this workshop asks students to apply the principles to themselves. Why are you a designer? What are your interests? How does that manifest?

• You will be able to articulate your personal position that will help you choose a worthwhile topic for your final project. \
• You will be able to know what you are interested in and care about (What brings you alive?). \
• You will be able to position yourself within a design context. \
• You will be able to show who else is doing the work you want to make. \
• You will be able to identify networks and communities of practice and position yourself within them. \
• You will will use foresight to project their ideas forward in order to design for the future. \
• You will learn that ALL design happens in the future and will be able to consider consequences of events and designs ahead of trends in order to generate novel concepts for your projects.
