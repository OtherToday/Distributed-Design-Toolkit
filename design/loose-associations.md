# 〰 Divergent research

### Loose Associations

‘Hello, I’m Ryan. Erm … all these things are linked somehow, but at times the associations may be a bit loose.’ Ryan Gander

​

In this brief you will be exploring and expanding your subject field and identifying a line of enquiry that is individual to you.

​

Next thursday 10/10/19 at 10am you will deliver a Pecha Kucha. A Pecha Kucha is a storytelling format, invented by designers Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham in 2003.

​

A presenter shows 20 slides for 20 seconds of commentary each (6 minutes and 40 seconds total).

## Task A - Creating a visual essay

This is not a PowerPoint presentation! You will construct this talk through links between images and the stories behind them. It is very important that this talk is personal to you and that you find it genuinly interesting - it is not an academic talk. This is creative research.

​

This talk should be constructed as if you have got lost in Wikipedia; each hyperlink taking you to another interesting thing. The aim of this research is to discover things you do not know about!

​

**Tips:**

* Your starting image should be something (or someone) you are interested in, know or care about

​

* Don't worry about the presentation yet, enjoy researching. Online or in the library.&#x20;

​

* Keep the jumps in topic small

## Task B - The Pecha Kucha

DP5 students should make a presentation of 10 slides and write 30 words per slide

​

DP6 students should make a presentation of 20 slides and write 30 words per slide

​

* Create your slideshow using some film editing software (e.g. imovie or adobe premier) Each image needs to be on screen for 20 seconds while you talk about it.

​

* For each slide write 30 words telling us what is interesting about this image

​

* Your first image doesn't need to be the thing you started with

​

* There will be tutorials on Monday  7th to talk through your individual interests

## Example:

In many ways the Chupa Chups lollipop, invented in 1958, is a bona-fide design classic. The logo, eye catchingly placed on top was designed by the surrealist artist Salvidor Dali. If you look really closely at the moth in this Silence of the Lambs poster you can see Dali's skull. These moths are called Deaths Head Moths and have what look like skulls on them.

Humans have made these moths change colour. The peppered moth used to be white but pollution has caused the surfaces it lands on to go black. Now it has evolved to blend in with soot rather than lichen...
