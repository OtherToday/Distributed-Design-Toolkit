​

Show divergent and process based thinking - this should not be a mood board of products you like. Show a thought process of loose associactions and _bisociations_ (read chapter 7, Rebel with a cause in Design for the Real World by Victor Papenek)

​

Demonstrate the ability to effectively and **ethically** gather information. Must include **PEOPLE PLANET PROFIT** and be presented as an infographic. The above is simplified, if you can recycle it, how? if it biodegrades, under what conditions? (Read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple\_bottom\_line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple\_bottom\_line))

## Making & experiments

​

Use **diverse techniques** that provide a **systemic understanding** of the **problem space**. This means that you should document yourself is trying different ideas and techniques out, you should be conisdering what happens at the begging middle and end of your products life (make it and break it). The problem space is made up of the contraints of the brief (one sheet, the letter box etc) and your own personal direction. You need to respect the constraints of the brief which includes showing and justifying any waste. This section is to evidence **PROCESS** and your divergent, exploritory path to your 'product'.
