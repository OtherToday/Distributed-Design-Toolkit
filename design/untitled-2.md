What: A recipe to make bio-receptive blocks that supports natural colonisation or can be pre-populated with alpine plants.

How: Use of spoilt fruit and veg, ice and balloons to make craters, voids and holes in a porous hypertufa style concrete.

Why: Increase biodiversity and the human-nature connection in urban spaces.

## PRODUCT PROPOSITION

Living blocks is an open source recipe designed to produce blocks that can support plant and insect life. Using inspiration from the porous structure of rare limestone formations, living blocks uses waste fruit, vegetable and aggregates to produce a similar porous structure in a cement based alternative.

## PORTFOLIO

## - About

I am a Brighton based designer working on my final undergraduate project. I have always been interested in materials, and sustainability but recently have become further interested in patterns, materials and generative art. Aside from my design practice I am also a chef and occasionally teach sailing and paddle boarding.

I started this project because I am also interested in the human-nature relation and how urban spaces could be more natural. This project explores the ways in which we can build with nature to increase the biodiversity in cities whilst also developing our connection to nature. Through interviewing experts in ecology, conservation and art, I discovered that in order to increase biodiversity in cities we need to alter the way we build. Currently cities are built with clean, smooth, regular shaped surfaces and spaces, with little focus on natural life. Living blocks aims to provide a basic open-source process people can use and adapt to build blocks or other shapes that provide complex, textured, bio-receptive surfaces that could provide rich ecosystems in urban spaces.

## - Specification

**Intstructions, Bill Of Materials, Mould plans**

​

[View Instructions PDF.pdf @ Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/viewer/RmlsZTozODEwODI=?filename=Instructions\_PDF.pdf)

​

​

**Step 1**

Cut out the parts for the mould. This can be done with a laser cutter using the .DXF in the files tab or by hand using the guide in the PDF above. Follow the visual instructions below for assembling the mould.

​

​

**Step 2**

In a bucket, mix together 1.5 litres of coco coir, 1.5 litres of vermiculite, and 1 litre of cement. Keep mixing until the ingredients are blended together. Easiest way of mixing is with a paddle mixer drill attachment but a big ladle or mixing spoon will work as well. As mentioned in the bill of materials, whilst the vermiculite provides nutrients and water retention, it is possible to use other aggregate materials you may have lying around such as perlite, crushed terracotta, concrete, or shingle. Just remember to keep to the ratio of 1 part cement to 1.5 part coco coir to 1.5 (other aggregates)

Add 500ml of water to the mixture, continue mixing and adding water until you achieve a consistency similar to cookie dough.

​

​

​

**Step 4**

Lubricate the mould using a mould release agent. I use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) which works just fine.

Spoon enough mixture to cover the base. Gently tamp the mixture down so that its flat and its pressed into the corners of the mould. Start to add tomatoes, balloons or ice cubes.

* Tomatoes - Consider how you will remove them once the block has set. I start by adding tomatoes on the edges and work my way in.
* Ice cubes - Again its best to place ice cubes near the edges or near to tomatoes or balloons so that the water can melt and escape to create small crevasses.
* Balloons - Used to make larger voids but very easy to pop so consider not blowing them up too much.

Keep repeating this process until you run out of mixture or the mould is full.

​

​

​

**Step 5**

Cover with plastic bag and leave to cure for 24 hours, remove from mould and place in to water and leave for another 24 hours. Using a spoon, knife or any other appropriate tool, remove the tomatoes and balloons. Occasionally a drill might be needed to access the deeper tomatoes. Leave for another week to allow further curing and the PH level of the concrete to reduce.

​

​

​

**Step 6**

As mentioned previously, the blocks can be pre-populated with alpine plants or be left in a garden as hosts for new ecosystems. Research suggests over the course of a year, the 3d structure and texture you have made should be bio receptive and easily colonisable, acting as landing pads for aerial plankton and substrates for seeds to germinate in. For a more aesthetic approach, alpine plants such as Sedums and Sempervivums can be planted or propagated in the blocks. Ideally use young plants or seedlings so that they fit in the holes and can grow a healthy root system inside the porous structure. Using a 50/50 grit to compost mix, fill the holes with soil. Insert the plants roots or stem in a hole and press more potting mix around it. Leave for 2 - 3 weeks whilst the roots establish before moving around.

​

**Living Blocks Visualiser**

Using Rhino's, Grasshopper plugin I have developed a definition that can be used to randomly distribute spherical holes within a block. Using the labelled slider tools in this Grasshopper definition allows you to easily visualise different geometry with randomly generated holes spread throughout the block. This might be useful for someone wanting to make a different size or shaped block. These models can then be exported, and used in architectural renders and drawings. The grasshopper file can be downloaded in the files tab. It also contains instructions on how to use it.

​

**Living Desk Hack**

Initially my interests for this project were centred around the human-nature connection and how this could be achieved through living and working amongst nature. I decided to explore this through the construction of a living workspace. This involved surrounding my desk space with plants and working on a desk made of alive moss and grass. I also decided to try a day of working outdoors, at the beach and in the South Downs.

​

![image](https://lawrenceparentdp610.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/working-in-nature-2.jpg)

**Insights**

* Very relaxing, feel at one with nature
* So stimulating that it sometimes becomes distracting
* Feels good to have a workspace that depends on me to water it
* **Deeper connection to the space around me -**
* **WHAT IF I COULD MAKE MORE THINGS LIVING?**
* **This led me to work on a new HMW statement: HOW MIGHT WE BUILD WITH NATURE?**

**Interview with Rachel White**

​

![image](https://wikifactory.com/files/RmlsZTozNzg3MDE=)

**Insights**

* Focusing on improving the human nature connection could be about giving people the tools to help nature flourish e.g. birdboxes, bug hotels etc.
* Rewilding gardens to provide green corridors or stepping stones

​

I then began experimenting with making a porous material able to support plant and insect life. I started by dipping dried loofah fruits in various concrete mixes. I then filled them with solid and grow cress out of them. [More](https://lawrenceparentdp610.wordpress.com/2020/02/20/concrete-loofah/).

​

![image](https://lawrenceparentdp610.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/luffaconcrete-1.jpg)

**Insights**

* The cement was too impermeable, acted like a skin around the loofah fibres
* Soil sits on surface or falls straight through the 3 central holes
* Limited by the shape of the loofah fruits

​

​

​

**Porous Ceramics**

Whilst exploring material that could support plant and insect life I came across the work of ceramicist, Studio Furthermore. They've developed a method for making a ceramic foam. From what I understand they soak sponges in ceramic slip and fire them in a kiln at a high temperature, burning away the sponge and leaving only a ceramic structure remaining.

**Insights**

* Had lots of potential but unable to finish experiments due to no access to a kiln because of Covid-19 lockdown

​

​

**Plaster Of Paris**

Working with plaster is an easy, and affordable material to work with at home so I began exploring using balloons to make larger craters that could be filled with soil or another growing medium and support plant and insect life. The inspiration for using balloons to make voids in plaster came from designer, Adam Guy Blencow. [More](https://lawrenceparentdp610.wordpress.com/2020/04/17/balloons-with-plaster/).

​

Sources: Bottom right: [https://adamguyblencowe.com/Balloon-Blocks](https://adamguyblencowe.com/Balloon-Blocks)

**Insights**

* Water balloons filled with air make good sized craters
* Using ball bearings can stop balloons floating to the top of plaster mix
* Squeezing in balloons to mould produces the most satisfying crater filled with blocks

​

​

**Homemade Lime Mortar**

Having developed a consistent method of making craters within a block of plaster I began to explore other mouldable, more permanent materials that could be used. I began exploring primitive methods of making concrete using shells collected during my daily exercise. The shells were then heated to make slaked lime. Unfortunately heating shells to the required temperature (830 degrees Celsius) in my back garden proved to be much harder than expected. [More](https://lawrenceparentdp610.wordpress.com/2020/04/18/lime-mortar-failed-attempts/).

​

![image](https://lawrenceparentdp610.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/lime-mortar.jpg)

**Insights**

* Without a foundry / larger fire making slaked lime is very difficult and arguably not a 'distributable' process.
* Despite using shells to make lime mortar being a primitive method, the energy required to heat the calcium carbonate and the Co2 release from the exothermic reaction suggests it is not the great for the environment.

​

​

**Tufa**

Whilst discussing my project with a friend studying horticulture, he mentioned how the material I was trying to achieve sounded very similar to the unusual and rare form of limestone that alpine gardeners use, tufa. Tufa has a porous consistency making it ideal for growing alpine plants which are well adapted rocky well drained terrain.

​

**Insights**

* Rare and therefore expensive so people have developed a manufactured substitute called hypertufa.

​

​

**Hypertufa**

Hypertufa is a man made rock typically made from cement, Sphagnum (peat moss), sand and perlite or vermiculite. With hypertufa being a cement based material, prior to curing the mixture is very mouldable making it easy to mould into desired shapes such as large planters and pots. Online guides on how to make hypertufa suggest different quantities of different materials. I could not find a guide on how to make hypertufa have the same physical appearance as natural tufa nor how to increase the porosity. I therefore began to explore difference mixes and processes to achieve a building block with similar texture/ appearance to natural tufa. [More](https://lawrenceparentdp610.wordpress.com/2020/05/15/hypertufa/).

![image](https://lawrenceparentdp610.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/hypertufa.jpg)

**Insights**

* Sphagnum moss is unsustainable so have substituted this for coco coir (a by-product from coconut industry)
* Sticking to the general rule of 1 part cement to 3 part aggregate and mixing things like crushed terracotta, shells or shingle in to the mix can be a good way of using up materials you already might have.
* Balloons, tomatoes and ice create the best holes and craters.

Hypertufa itself is porous due to the use of an organic medium such as coco coir, by adding tomatoes, balloons and ice in to the mix, I can achieve larger craters, voids, and cracks in the block. This makes it the ideal structure for plants and insects to live inside.

​

​

**Alpine Plants**

At this point I began to perfect the process and worked on slightly different ratios of ingredients and began seeing what plants are best suited to growing out of the blocks. I discussed with a friend studying horticulture on the most suitable alpine plants for my blocks.

​

![](https://lawrenceparentdp610.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/alpine-plants.jpg)

**Insights**

* Plants would need to be easy to establish / young seedlings
* Suited to the substrate (Alpine plants like rocky well drained locations)
* Able to persist in environments where they might not be looked after (e.g., drought/frost tolerant)
* Low growing – generally up to 30cm

**Feedback from Ian Boyd and Nigel George, Directors at Artecology**

Artecology are a world-class multi-discipline collaboration of ecologists, artists, scientists, engineers, planners and architects developing constructed wildlife habitats within the built environment. Presenting my work to them over zoom, receiving feedback and discussing ways of moving the project further has been invaluable.

​

**Insights**

Both of them gave me really positive feedback on the project and suggested some people to get in contact with in order to continue the project beyond University.

* Ian liked the blocks and described them as "A 3D high complexity, concentrated approach using a novel material that can support natural colonisation but can also be pre-populated". He went on to explain that green roofs are an effective and popular method of increasing biodiversity in cities but are limited by how they are very flat and thin and how my approach solves that issue by suggesting they can be used to build larger 3D structures.
* Nigel mentioned some more environmentally friendly ingredients I should experiment with such as Vicat Prompt and carbon neutral cement. He also discussed how design can be used to change peoples perceptions of rewilding.

(Audio clips available through link in appendix)

​

**Use**

The blocks can be used in a range of different ways. As mentioned by Ian from Artecology, the blocks don't need to be pre-populated with plants and over the course of a year things will begin living and growing out of them. Equally the blocks could be used as a feature in a garden, used to build walls or even as bio receptive way marker / totem poles.

![image](https://lawrenceparentdp610.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/untitled-1.jpg)

**Current plans for further development**

* Continued testing of particular plant species that grow well out of the blocks
* Continued testing of the blocks in different conditions (forested area, underground, underwater etc.)
* Contact researchers working within the field of green grey infrastructure
* Roll out testing across a city through contacting country and conservation trusts

## - Analysis

![image](https://wikifactory.com/files/RmlsZTozNzg3MTM=)

​

**People**

Countless reports highlight the benefits of the human-nature relationship (Richardson and McEwan, 2018), however, the current model for the construction of new buildings and cities centres around the efficiency of maintenance with little focus on quality of life. This results in the construction of clean, smooth, regular shaped surfaces and spaces, with little focus on natural life. As a result of the shortfalls of this industry the installation of living blocks as cladding, garden walls, waymarkers etc. hopes to provide flourishing biodiverse ecosystems as well as adding interesting aesthetic value to build spaces.

**Planet**

The initial impact of the manufacturing of the block is high however, overtime the benefits for the planet and local ecosystems will outweigh the negative impact. The use of cement and vermiculite (or perlite) both require huge amounts of energy. Cement in particular has a large impact due to the significant amounts of CO2 given off during the reaction required to breakdown calcium carbonate to calcium oxide. Concrete is the second most consumed substance in the world after water (Gagg, 2014), on top of this, the majority of it produced has zero ecological value. Therefore, intervening with an understood, developed material that through the process of making living blocks, attempts to mitigate this and provide positive impacts on local wildlife and people then it is still a good choice of material.

**Profit**

The recipe and process for making the living blocks will be free, open-source and available online for other designers, gardeners or wildlife conservationists. However, I plan to continue developing the project and hope to work with other companies and researchers already working within the field of green-grey infrastructure. Whilst it’s currently not a largely profitable industry, there are quite a few organisations that offer grants and funding. Also, the PR value many construction and retail companies see in biodiversity project which also have aesthetic value suggests the possibility of making a profit.
