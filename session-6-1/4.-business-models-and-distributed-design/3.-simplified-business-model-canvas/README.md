# 3. Simplified Business Model Canvas

This simplified layout (the original was by [Osterwalder and Pigneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business\_Model\_Canvas)), gives you a birdâ€™s eye view of your activity to spark new ideas from a different perspective. It also enables collaborative discussions on by helping to set out the key elements and showing how everything interrelates, particularly when related to social and environmental impact.

The Miro board contains one example and one blank canvas. Go through the example with the group until the basic concepts are grasped, then divide the group into threes and give each group a task to fill in the canvas for a particular company.&#x20;

A further stage can be added where students fill in the canvas for their current project.
