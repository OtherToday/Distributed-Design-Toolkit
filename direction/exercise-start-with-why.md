# ã€° Finding Purpose

## â€‹ðŸŽ¯**Invitation**

Take inspiration from the work of Simon Sinek to develop your own 'why statement'. Through a series of activities, you will explore the  idea of The Golden Circle and how it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.

Start by looking at the three tabs below.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Inspiration" %}
## **What is the Golden Circle?**

Simon Sinek presents a simple but powerful model for how leaders inspire action, starting with a golden circle and the question "Why?" His examples include Apple, Martin Luther King, and the Wright brothers**.**

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Purpose" %}
In Distributed Design the way you communicate your project is as important as the product itself. Makers of our designs encounter them as instructions and recipes hosted and shared online.&#x20;

We want consumers/ citizens to choose Distributed Designs over mass-produced products. A strong graphic identity for the designer and brand for the product is key to this desirability.&#x20;

The purpose of this section of the toolkit is&#x20;

* To understand graphic identity
* To choose suitable fonts and colours
* To apply them to a manifesto that conveys your personal position
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="To Do" %}
1. You need to have completed [Start with Why](exercise-start-with-why.md) before this section
2. Read this section top to bottom first
3. Do the [Type Suitability activity](exercise-start-with-why.md#type-suitability-activity)
4. Do the [Colour Palette activity](your-graphic-identity.md#colour-palette-activity)
5.  Do the [Manifesto activity](your-graphic-identity.md#making-your-manifesto)


{% endtab %}

#### WORKSHOP PART ONE

The first part of this workshop asks students to take an example company (in the example below we have used Kniterate), look at their online presence and analyse what their Why, How and What might be.

#### WORKSHOP PART TWO

The second part of this workshop asks students to apply the principles to themselves. Why are you a designer? What are your interests? How does that manifest?

â€¢ You will be able to articulate your personal position that will help you choose a worthwhile topic for your final project. \
â€¢ You will be able to know what you are interested in and care about (What brings you alive?).

â€¢ You will be able to position yourself within a design context. \
â€¢ You will be able to show who else is doing the work you want to make. \
â€¢ You will be able to identify networks and communities of practice and position yourself within them. \
â€¢ You will will use foresight to project their ideas forward in order to design for the future. \
â€¢ You will learn that ALL design happens in the future and will be able to consider consequences of events and designs ahead of trends in order to generate novel concepts for your projects.
