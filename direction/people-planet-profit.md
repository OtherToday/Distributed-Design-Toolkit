# „Ä∞ People Planet Profit

## ‚ÄãüéØ **Invitation**

John Elkinton‚Äôs **triple bottom line** business metaphor of People Planet, Profit (PPP) is a way into the complexity of sustainability.&#x20;

Although simple this abstraction de-centers the designers focus from the usual one of consumer or **Profit** to also consider the impact on and interactions of humanity **People** and the environment  and **Planet**.

PPP is a gateway to discussion around sustainability and is a useful tool for auditing the impact of your work and of other products.&#x20;

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f5m-jBf81Q" %}

This whiteboard animation video from Youtube presents the concept of the triple bottom line and uses science to suggest a different way to look at it. This provides businesses with new perspective on the rationale for integrating sustainability into who and how they are in the world. This is also known as the 3 pillars of sustainability.

{% tab title="Recall" %}




It should be noted that in 2018 John Elkington [recalled the model](https://johnelkington.com/2018/07/recalling-the-triple-bottom-line/) as corporations started using it as a green washing tool. After using it as an introduction your should develop your literacy around sustainability with more complex impact modelling.
