{% tab title="Purpose" %}
The tools of Distributed Design are ambivalent to the materials put them and proprietry or industrial standard sheets, filaments and blocks can be replaced by materials we can find and make locally. When creating or using new materials we need to be able to repeat our results. The purpose of this toolkit is to introduce the designer to basic scientific recording techniques. These tools are not only useful in material testing but in all experimentation within design.
