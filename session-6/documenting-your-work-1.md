## ****:dart: **Invitation**

In Distributed Design, your documentation may be the first thing someone sees when they encounter your project. If you want your work to be replicated, improved and adapted to new contexts, you need to consider how to invite people in; how to tell the story of your design; and what technical information you need to provide to  help them distribute it.

In pandemic conditions, this work is both more urgent, and more challenging. With Andrew, we look at some ways to get started.&#x20;

Start by looking at the three tabs below.

Andrew Sleigh is a designer and maker working in Brighton, UK. He is passionate about sharing your work; without it your project just exists on a desk in your studio.

He advocates building the documentation process into the design process as a form of reflective design process. His top tip: write notes, and take photos and videos as you work so you have all the assets you need when you want to share it.

{% tab title="Purpose" %}
Documentation tells the story of why your product is interesting and gives others something to share further.

In traditional product or industrial design, the documentation is often left to others, for instance, the manufacturer.  In Distributed Design, it is important that these assets are owned by the designer.&#x20;

We want consumers/ citizens to choose Distributed Designs over mass-produced products. Great photography and clear and easy-to-follow instructions enhance this desirability.&#x20;

The purpose of this section of the toolkit is&#x20;

* To understand why documentation is so important in Distributed Design
* To learn some tools and tips for creating great documentation
* To apply them to a project of your own

## Introduction

These 3 videos are designed to provide an introduction to product photography for absolute beginners. By experimenting with household items, we find ways of staging and lighting products to get pretty good results without spending any money.

There are also some ideas on how to take your lighting to thenext level. Once you've mastered te basics, you'll be in a much beter position to know where to invest money, or what you need to focus on to improve.&#x20;

### Some nice documentation examples

#### Technical Journal, showing WiP: Jacob Stanton&#x20;

### Reading list

GIFs (or short looping films) These are great examples that show key mechanisms â€“ scroll about â…” down the page: http://www.jacobstanton.com/3d-printed-hand-screw-clamp/

This whole page is a great example that shows technical development of a project prototype.

End-user instructions (if youâ€™re making a product for user assembly, customisation, or distributed manufacture) How Ikeaâ€™s Assembly Instructions Champion Universal Design: https://magenta.as/how-ikeas-assembly-instructions-champion-universal-design-fe2710ab5c36

There are many different formats designers can use to share thir work. Here, they've made good use of an alternative format that breaks free of technical conventions.

If youâ€™re making a product for user assembly, customisation, or distributed manufacture, you can do worse than study Ikea's end-user instrucions, and consider how the needs of instructions themselves impact the design of the physical product.

#### Storytelling: Kickstarter Creator Handbook

[https://www.kickstarter.com/help/handbook/your\_story?ref=handbook\_index](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/handbook/your\_story?ref=handbook\_index)

Crowd-funding campaigns are a stress test for sucessfully integrating different media to communicate a design proposition.&#x20;

#### Book: Show Your Work, by Austin Keon

[https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)

This short, fun read is a manifesto for _why_ you should document your work, and a non-technical guide on _how_.

### Andrew's Plotter Project

[https://andrewsleigh.com/plotter/](https://andrewsleigh.com/plotter/)

This pen plotter was designed to be a replicable project, distributed through DIY maker communities. By documenting the project in a variety of ways, from technical (BOMs, 3D CAD files) to non-technical (videos, motivations) Andrew was able to realise more value from the project and have greater impact than working alone. &#x20;
