# Exercise: Business models

### Time needed

120 mins for the three part workshop

### Purpose

Businesses have a huge impact on our world. This exercise is to begin to understand the many ways that this can happen. Student projects will be richer and more dimensional with an understanding of the impact that a venture can achieve.

### Brief summary

In the first session we first introduce the concept of a business. We then move on to business models, and look at examples of interesting business models and the impact they have on the world.

We also introduce the idea of impact on People, Planet, Profit as a useful (if flawed) lens.

The second session introduces Simone Sinek's [Start with Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNSAolUgFYQ)

The third session introduces a simplified business model canvas.

By the end of these sessions the student should have a good understanding of how their projects (which are proto businesses) can affect the world.
