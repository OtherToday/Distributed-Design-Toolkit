# 3.Introduction to Orientation and Vision

To achieve a sustainable, fair, and just society together, we must be able to radically rethink our world. Complex environmental and social challenges are not static: they can’t simply be ‘fixed’. Rather than seeing our work as a ‘problem and solution’, we should start with a hopeful vision of what we want to achieve, and develop a clear mission from that.

It is important to begin any project in a positive, values-driven way. If you are working with a team, spending time with team members and other stakeholders at the outset to build trust allows you to collectively return to these values throughout the process.

It can be helpful to use the I/We/World framework during the discover phase, and see what you can find out about yourself, your project/team/local situation, and the wider global context.
