This Studio is located in the world of distributed design, and with it the potential to reduce the environmental and social impact of manufacturing. Focusing on new methods of digital and social making (Fab Labs), using local materials (Bio and Recycled) and rethinking what happens to products that are no longer needed (Circular Economy). This work is connected to the Fab City global initiative of transitioning cities to be zero waste by 2054. This type of design will completely disrupt the way that products are currently made, sold and used.﻿\
﻿\
Students joining this studio will share ideas with a global network, using video, open design instructions and social media. The products themselves are manufactured locally using machines commonly found in makerspaces, small scale producers, shed and kitchens. The Studio will be supported by a series of lectures, weekly tutorials and technical support.﻿\
﻿\
You will invent tools for making, share kits and knowledge, hack systems, re-code objects, brew, melt and craft materials. You will create products that will aim to change the world.﻿\
