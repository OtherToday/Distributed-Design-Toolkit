# Welcome/Purpose/Intention

Change this for intro and design council stuff

Need to define who this Git Book is for and what we are expecting them to get out of it.

* Us in the future
* Any tutor
* Other tutors add to it?
* Students are directed to it

Also good for answering question 'what is distributed design?'
